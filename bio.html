                <p class="home">    As a child, Stephen Colbert directed Star Wars IV through VII, solved world hunger, and brought peace to the Middle East. He is the beloved founder of Google, Apple and Microsoft. At age 14, he carried The New England Patriots to their first Super Bowl after Drew Bledsoe went down with an injury. Not a single team has figured out a way to beat him since. At age 20 he discovered the cure for Cancer. In the late 90’s he starred as a cast member on John Stewart’s The Daily Show. His work on The Daily Show would later solidify his celebrity status and give him immeasurable worldwide fame. Stephen has been busy winning the Noble Peace Prize the past ten years in a row, and has now set his site on becoming the new leader of the free world...The President of the United States of South Carolina. His campaign is focused on topics including Wall Street, campaign finance, energy policy, healthcare, eating on the campaign trail, and the United States Constitution.</p>
